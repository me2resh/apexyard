## You built something real with AI. Then it fell apart.

The first 80% flew — a working prototype in a weekend, features landing faster than you could test them. Then the context slipped. The codebase turned into a pile nobody could review, decisions vanished into chat history, and the thing you were *so close* to shipping never actually made it to production.

**ApexYard is the machinery that takes agent-built code the last mile.** It wraps your AI coding agent in the discipline a real engineering team runs on: every change moves through a ticket, gets an independent review, and hits a merge gate that stays shut until a *named human* says "ship it." So the code your agent writes is actually safe to put in front of users.

Concretely, it's a multi-project **ops repo**: you fork it, register your projects, and govern them all as one organisation — shared memory across the portfolio, a strict SDLC, and **42 shell hooks** that enforce the rules mechanically instead of hoping everyone remembers them. Built for founders who ship alone, and for teams standing up AI-enabled squads.

Claude Code is the default driver, but the rules, hooks, and templates are plain markdown and shell. Swap the AI. Keep the forge. No SaaS. No lock-in.

**Proven shipping** TypeScript + AWS Lambda backends, Next.js web apps, Chrome extensions, and native **Swift** macOS desktop apps. The stack is process and guardrails — not a language or framework lock-in.

## What's inside

ApexYard is a set of plain-text primitives Claude Code reads automatically — no runtime, no service:

- **20 roles** across 6 departments (engineering, product, design, security, data, architecture) that activate on triggers
- **42 shell hooks** that mechanically enforce the SDLC — ticket-first edits, a two-marker merge gate, migration gates, secrets scanning, and more
- **64 slash-command skills** — from `/setup` and `/handover` to `/decide`, `/code-review`, `/migration`, and `/launch-check`
- **25 sub-agents** — Rex (code review), Hakim (security), Tariq (design review), plus the department personas
- **15 rule files**, workflow docs, and document templates (PRD, tech design, ADR, AgDR, C4 diagrams)

**Full directory tree and the complete role / hook / skill / agent breakdown → [`docs/whats-inside.md`](docs/whats-inside.md).**

> **Marketing site:** the site that was previously bundled here has moved to its own repo ([me2resh/apexyard-site](https://github.com/me2resh/apexyard-site)) and is deployed independently at [yard.apexscript.com](https://yard.apexscript.com).
>
> **For AI coding agents:** the repo root carries `AGENTS.md` — universal entry doc for Cursor / Claude Code / Aider / Cline / **pi**. For harnesses that don't auto-load `CLAUDE.md` (pi chief among them), `AGENTS.md`'s "Operator governance bridge" section carries the same advisory SDLC governance `CLAUDE.md` gives Claude Code — see [`docs/harnesses/pi.md`](docs/harnesses/pi.md) for what's bridged today vs. not yet.

## Quick Start — fork and go

ApexYard governs a **portfolio of repos** as one organisation. You fork apexyard, clone the fork, treat it as your "ops repo", and register every project you want under management. No `.apexyard/` symlinks, no nested installs — the fork IS the ops repo.

### 1. Star + Fork on GitHub

Visit [`github.com/me2resh/apexyard`](https://github.com/me2resh/apexyard), **Star** it, then **Fork** it into your org. You can keep the fork named `apexyard` or rename to something that fits your naming convention (`your-org/ops`, `your-org/apex`, etc.).

### 2. Clone your fork locally

```bash
gh repo clone your-org/apexyard
cd apexyard
```

Or with plain git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/apexyard.git
cd apexyard
```

### 3. Add `upstream` for future updates

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/me2resh/apexyard.git
```

Later, run **`/update`** to pull the latest apexyard improvements into your fork — it previews the upstream diff, merges on a sync branch, and walks you through any per-version migrations (don't hand-merge `main`).

### 4. Configure the framework — run `/setup`

Run **`/setup`** in Claude Code. In three exchanges (describe your stack → review the proposed defaults → accept or tweak) it captures your company, team, tech stack, and quality bar and writes your config.

```text
/setup
```

Your real config lives in `onboarding.yaml`, which is **gitignored** — it stays local and is never published. `/setup` copies it from the tracked `onboarding.example.yaml` placeholder and fills it in, so nothing private is committed. (A commit-time guard blocks a filled-in `onboarding.yaml` if you ever try to add it.)

### 5. Register your projects — run `/handover`

Projects join the portfolio through a skill, not hand-edited YAML. For each repo you want under management:

```text
/handover <repo-url-or-local-path>
```

**`/handover`** clones the repo, scores its "harnessability" across five dimensions, seeds its per-project docs, and **registers it in `apexyard.projects.yaml`** (creating the registry on first use). `/setup` also offered to register your first project back in step 4.

The registry it maintains looks like this — you rarely touch it by hand:

```yaml
version: 1
projects:
  - name: example-app
    repo: your-org/example-app
    docs: projects/example-app
    status: active
```

Register even a single repo — the portfolio skills (`/projects`, `/inbox`, `/status`) work off the registry. (Prefer to bootstrap it manually? `cp apexyard.projects.yaml.example apexyard.projects.yaml` still works.)

### 6. Start working

```
/projects          # list every managed project + status
/inbox             # PRs, issues, comments needing your attention
/status            # git + CI snapshot per project
/decide            # make a technical decision (creates an AgDR)
```

The hooks fire on every `git` / `gh` command, the portfolio skills aggregate across the registry, and the Code Reviewer agent can be invoked with `/code-review <pr>`.

Full setup guide with directory layout, daily workflow, and FAQ: [`docs/multi-project.md`](docs/multi-project.md).

Keeping a fork current — upgrade in place, when to re-fork instead, and how to preserve your portfolio data either way: [`docs/upgrading.md`](docs/upgrading.md).

## Why ApexYard?

**The problem**: Claude Code is powerful, but without structure it produces inconsistent results. Every team reinvents the same processes -- role definitions, review checklists, document templates, workflow gates.

**The solution**: ApexYard provides that structure as a reusable, open-source stack. One config file to customize, 20 role definitions to use, battle-tested workflows to follow, and 42 shell hooks that enforce the rules mechanically.

### What makes it different

| Feature | Without ApexYard | With ApexYard |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Code reviews | Ad-hoc prompts | Rex agent on every PR, SHA-bound approval marker |
| Technical decisions | Lost in chat history | Documented as Agent Decision Records |
| Quality gates | Hope and pray | 42 shell hooks block bad commits, forged markers, unreviewed merges |
| Merge approval | Informal "LGTM" | Two-marker gate — Rex (code) + CEO (per-PR explicit) |
| Database migrations | Drop-column-on-Friday | Dedicated gate: labelled ticket + migration AgDR (rollback, downtime, consumers) required before schema edits |
| Architecture docs | Nobody draws them | C4 L1 + L2 Mermaid templates + `/c4` skill generates stubs from a codebase |
| Portfolio visibility | Tab through 5 GitHubs | `/inbox`, `/status`, `/tasks` aggregate across a single registry file |
| Upstream sync | Forget for 6 months | Session-start drift banner + `/update` skill |
| Role consistency | Re-explain every session | Persistent role definitions, activation-triggered |
| Onboarding | Days of context-setting | `/setup` three-exchange config |

## Roles, workflows & templates

ApexYard ships **20 roles** across 6 departments that activate on triggers, a full **SDLC** (Planning → Design → Build → Review → QA → Deploy → Monitor) with a dedicated migration sub-workflow, and reusable **document templates** (PRD, technical design, ADR, AgDR, migration AgDR, C4 diagrams).

The full role roster, workflow detail, and template catalogue live in **[`docs/whats-inside.md`](docs/whats-inside.md)**. The canonical entry point Claude Code reads is [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Show you're governed by ApexYard

Running your repo under ApexYard? Add a badge to its README. Every adopter repo that carries one is a backlink and a bit of social proof — and `/handover` will offer to drop it into the repos it onboards.

**Governed by** — for a repo managed under an ApexYard ops fork:

## Customization

ApexYard is designed to be customized. Every role, workflow, and template can be modified to fit your team:

1. **Add roles**: Create new `.md` files in `roles/your-department/`
2. **Modify workflows**: Edit files in `workflows/`
3. **Add templates**: Drop new templates in `templates/`
4. **Override anything**: The stack is just markdown files -- edit freely

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — **start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the full fork → PR → review flow, and open issues with the **Bug report** / **Feature request** templates. All participation is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Security issues go through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) (private reporting), not public issues.

ApexYard runs on its own rules, so the flow mirrors any project under ApexYard governance:

1. **File an issue** — open a GitHub issue with the **Bug report** / **Feature request** template. If you run apexyard yourself, the **`/report-apexyard-bug`** and **`/request-apexyard-feature`** skills file it here for you (they target `me2resh/apexyard` — distinct from `/bug` and `/feature`, which file into your *own* managed project).
2. **Start the ticket** — `/start-ticket <number>` so the ticket-first hook lets your code edits through.
3. **Branch + commit** — `{type}/GH-{number}-{short-description}`, conventional commit format (`type(#number): subject`).
4. **Self-check before pushing** — `npm run lint` / markdownlint / shellcheck as applicable; hooks remind you at `git push`.
5. **Open a PR** — title `type(#number): description` + a Glossary section in the body.
6. **Wait for Rex** — the Code Reviewer agent auto-runs on every PR.
7. **Merge requires two markers** — Rex's approval + explicit per-PR CEO approval via `/approve-merge <pr>`. Plan-level "go" doesn't count.

For larger changes (new skills, rule changes, workflow redesigns), open a discussion or draft PRD first.
